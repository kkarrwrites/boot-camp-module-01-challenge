# Boot Camp - Module 1 Challenge - HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## About

An HTML, CSS, Git, and accessibility code refactor challenge for UConn Boot Camp.

## Description

This project involved taking starter code (HTML, CSS, and images) and refactoring the HTML and CSS to fit a variety of acceptance criteria. Some of the acceptance criteria included making the HTML more accessible by using semantic HTML elements, making the images accessible by using alt tags, making the structure and organization of the CSS logical, and writing a README file.

The main challenge I encountered while completing this project was deciding if I should keep the classes that were included in the starter code or if I should remove the classes and style the project using semantic elements alone. In the end, I decided to keep the classes because in accordance to some CSS methodologies (like BEM and OOCSS), it is often not advisable to style by tag names.
