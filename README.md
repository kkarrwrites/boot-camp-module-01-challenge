# Module 1 Challenge

## About

An HTML, CSS, Git, and accessibility code refactor challenge for UConn Boot Camp.

## Description

This project involved taking starter code that included HTML, CSS, and images and refactoring the HTML and CSS to fit a variety of acceptance criteria. The central goal of this project was to make the HTML more accessible by incorporating semantic HTML elements. The accessibility of the images was also addressed, as was making the structure and organization of the CSS logical.

The main challenge I encountered while completing this project was deciding if it was best to keep the classes that were included in the starter code or if it was best to remove the classes and style the project using semantic elements alone. In the end, I decided to keep the classes because in accordance to some CSS methodologies (like BEM and OOCSS), it is often not advisable to style by tag names.
